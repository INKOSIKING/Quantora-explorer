# Quantora Platform - Comprehensive Security Enforcement

- Admission controls (Gatekeeper) enforce labeling, anti-privilege, network, and resource policy.
- Falco runs on all nodes for real-time intrusion/anomaly detection.
- All ingress is TLS-terminated and protected by ModSecurity WAF.
- All public endpoints are rate-limited and DDoS-protected at ingress.
- All critical infra and app configs are policy-checked in CI via Conftest/OPA.
- Audit logs are centralized, replicated, and immutable.
- Every push and PR is scanned for secrets, policy violations, and infrastructure drift.
- All containers are non-root, non-privileged, and resource-constrained.
- All secrets are dynamically mounted from Vault via CSI.
- All sensitive actions/requests are logged and monitored in real time.
- All branch protection, code review, and signed commit policies are enforced in CI/CD.
