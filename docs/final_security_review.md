# Final Security Review: Explorer

- [x] XSS: All user input/output is sanitized (see `ui/src/utils/sanitize.ts`), React escapes by default, special checks on contract source display.
- [x] CSRF: All state-changing endpoints require CSRF tokens; only GET is public.
- [x] SSRF: All webhooks and integrations validate URLs, block internal IPs.
- [x] Rate Limiting: `/api` endpoints protected by Redis-based limiter (see `explorer/src/rate_limit.rs`).
- [x] Open Redirect: All redirects checked to avoid user-controlled URLs.
- [x] Dependency audit: `npm audit`, `cargo audit` clean.
- [x] Security headers: Set via NGINX/Express (`X-Frame-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy`).
