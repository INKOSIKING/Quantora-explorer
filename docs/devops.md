# Quantora Chain: DevOps & Automation

## 1. CI/CD Pipeline

- Use GitHub Actions (see `.github/workflows/`) for:
  - Build & test on PRs and pushes
  - Lint, audit, and fuzzing jobs
  - Release automation (tag, build, publish)

---

## 2. Node Automation

- Use systemd for auto-restart and monitoring
- Watchdog scripts for health checks and auto-restart on stall
- Backup scripts for periodic state/data snapshotting

---

## 3. Monitoring

- Prometheus metrics exporter built-in
- Grafana dashboards: see `monitoring/grafana/`
- Sentry for error/exception tracking

---

## 4. Scaling

- Deploy behind load balancers for high-volume APIs
- Use Kubernetes StatefulSets for elastic scaling
- Monitor for resource usage and auto-scale as needed

---

## 5. Logging & Alerts

- Centralized logging via Loki, ELK, or similar
- Alerting on:
  - Node offline
  - Block lag
  - High error rates
  - Low validator participation

---

## 6. Security Automation

- Automated CVE scans with `cargo audit` and Dependabot
- Secrets scanning in CI
- Automated notification for dependency vulnerabilities

---

## 7. Disaster Recovery

- Daily offsite data snapshots
- Regular test restores
- Documented runbooks for common incident types

---

## 8. Example Monitoring Query

```
qta_block_height{job="quantora"} - ignoring(instance) group_left() qta_block_height{job="quantora", instance="mainnet-1"} < 5
```
This triggers if a node lags behind the mainnet by more than 5 blocks.
