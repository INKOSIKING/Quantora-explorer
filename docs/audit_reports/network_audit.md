**Date:** 2025-05-03  
**Auditor:** BlockchainSecOps

---

## Scope

- `network/mod.rs`
- Peer management, handshake, broadcast logic
- Network tests

---

## Summary

- **Critical:** 0
- **High:** 1 (fixed)
- **Medium:** 1 (fixed)
- **Low:** 1 (fixed)

---

## Findings

### High

1. **Peer Flooding/Resource Exhaustion**
   - *Issue:* Unbounded peer connections allowed DoS.
   - *Fix:* Enforced max connections (64/128) and back-off.

### Medium

1. **Handshake Spoofing**
   - *Issue:* Lack of handshake replay protection.
   - *Fix:* Added random session nonces and challenge/response.

### Low

1. **Broadcast Loop**
   - *Issue:* Broadcast could resend to same peer multiple times.
   - *Fix:* Deduplication logic added.

---

## Recommendations

- Consider TLS for production deployments.
- Add further Sybil resistance with reputation scoring.
- Continue network fuzzing and simulation.

**Status:** All issues fixed and retested.
