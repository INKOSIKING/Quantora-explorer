# Quantora Chain: State/Transaction Engine Audit

**Date:** 2025-05-05  
**Auditor:** BlockchainSecOps

---

## Scope

- `state/mod.rs` (including sharding and parallelism)
- All state transition and transaction logic

---

## Summary

- **Critical:** 0
- **High:** 0
- **Medium:** 1 (fixed)
- **Low:** 2 (fixed)

---

## Findings

### Medium

1. **Shard Indexing Collisions**
   - *Issue:* Early version of sharding used a weak hash, causing collisions.
   - *Fix:* Switched to `twox-hash` and increased SHARD_COUNT to 4096.

### Low

1. **Potential Nonce Race**
   - *Issue:* Parallel tx application could race on nonce increment.
   - *Fix:* Stricter lock ordering and per-shard nonce locks.

2. **Balance Underflow on Concurrent Withdrawals**
   - *Issue:* Lack of atomicity for concurrent debits.
   - *Fix:* Now all balance updates use a single lock per address per shard.

---

## Recommendations

- Further investigate lock-free structures for even higher TPS.
- Continue heavy fuzzing and real-world simulation.

**Status:** All issues resolved and verified.
