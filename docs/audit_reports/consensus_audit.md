# Quantora Chain: Consensus Module Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-05-01  
**Auditor:** BlockchainSecOps

---

## Scope

- `consensus/mod.rs`
- `consensus/pow.rs`
- `consensus/pos.rs`
- All related tests

---

## Summary

- **Critical:** 0
- **High:** 0
- **Medium:** 2 (see below)
- **Low:** 3 (see below)

---

## Findings

### Medium

1. **PoW Difficulty Boundary**
   - *Issue:* Non-constant difficulty could be manipulated if not set in config or not updated by protocol rules.
   - *Fix:* Enforce minimum/maximum bounds and periodic difficulty adjustment (see commit 4e1d...).

2. **POS Validator Selection Bias**
   - *Issue:* Early version selected highest-stake account; vulnerable to predictability.
   - *Fix:* Introduced VRF/randomized weighted selection (see pos.rs v1.2+).

### Low

1. **Nonce Overflow**
   - *Issue:* Nonce values not checked for overflows.
   - *Fix:* Added overflow check and hard cap.

2. **No Logging on Consensus Failure**
   - *Issue:* Block validation failure was silent.
   - *Fix:* Now logs detailed error to audit log.

3. **Test Coverage Gaps**
   - *Issue:* No fuzzing for rare edge-cases in consensus.
   - *Fix:* Fuzz tests added for block/tx reordering.

---

## Recommendations

- Periodically review random number source for PoS.
- Integrate with external entropy for VRF where possible.
- Continue to run all tests and fuzzers on every commit.
