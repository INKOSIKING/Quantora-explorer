# Quantora Explorer - Help Center

## What is the Explorer?

The Quantora Explorer lets you view blockchain activity in real-time, including:

- Recent blocks and transactions
- Wallet balances and history
- Smart contract data

## How do I find my transaction?

- Enter your transaction hash in the search bar.
- Or, browse recent transactions on the home page.

## How can I see my wallet balance?

- Enter your wallet address in the search bar.
- Your balance and recent activity will be displayed.

## Troubleshooting

- If you do not see your transaction, wait for a few more blocks or check you are on the correct network.
- For unconfirmed transactions, try resubmitting or contact support.
