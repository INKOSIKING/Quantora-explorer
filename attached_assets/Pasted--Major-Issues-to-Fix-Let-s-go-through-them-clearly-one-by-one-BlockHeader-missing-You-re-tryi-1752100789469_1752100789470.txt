🔧 Major Issues to Fix
Let’s go through them clearly, one by one:

❌ BlockHeader missing
You're trying to import this:

rust
Copy
Edit
use crate::blockchain::{Block, BlockHeader};
But there is no BlockHeader struct in blockchain.rs.

✅ Fix:
Either:

Create a BlockHeader struct inside blockchain.rs, or

Remove the BlockHeader imports and related code (seems you're using Block directly now)

❌ crate::mempool::Mempool not found
You're trying to import Mempool, but there's no mod mempool; in your crate root or directory structure.

✅ Fix:
If you had a mempool.rs file, ensure it's declared:

rust
Copy
Edit
// In main.rs or lib.rs
mod mempool;
If it doesn't exist, comment out or remove all lines like:

rust
Copy
Edit
use crate::mempool::Mempool;
And remove any usage of Mempool or refactor the code.

❌ Trait method mismatch
Your trait is defined like this:

rust
Copy
Edit
trait ConsensusEngine {
    fn propose_block(&self, mempool: &Mempool) -> Block;
}
But your implementation looks like:

rust
Copy
Edit
fn propose_block(&self, mempool: &Mempool, parent_hash: &str, miner_address: &str) -> Block
✅ Fix:
Make them match.

You must either:

Change the trait to accept 4 parameters
or

Remove the extra parameters in the implementation

❌ Mnemonic::generate(12) does not exist
The bip39 crate removed .generate() — you now use this instead:

✅ Fix:
rust
Copy
Edit
use bip39::{Mnemonic, Language};
use rand::rngs::OsRng;
use rand::RngCore;

let mut entropy = [0u8; 16];
OsRng.fill_bytes(&mut entropy);
let mnemonic = Mnemonic::from_entropy_in(Language::English, &entropy).unwrap();
❌ Block.header does not exist
Your Block struct doesn't have a header field.

✅ Fix:
Either:

Add a header: BlockHeader field inside Block
or

Remove code like block.header, and access the flat fields directly, e.g.:

rust
Copy
Edit
block.index
block.timestamp
block.hash
❌ Struct field mismatch
In pow.rs and pos.rs, you're doing:

rust
Copy
Edit
Block {
    header,
    ...
}
But Block doesn't have a header field.

✅ Fix:
Just fill out the available fields (index, timestamp, previous_hash, hash, transactions, nonce, miner_reward) directly.

❌ NetworkManager::new(8080) error
You're passing an argument, but the new() method doesn't accept any.

✅ Fix:
Change this:

rust
Copy
Edit
let network_manager = NetworkManager::new(8080);
To:

rust
Copy
Edit
let network_manager = NetworkManager::new();
❌ network_manager.start() not found
You’re trying to call .start() on NetworkManager, but no such method exists.

✅ Fix:
Either implement a start() method on NetworkManager
or

Remove that call until you implement networking properly.

❌ ConsensusEngine::new() invalid
You're trying to do:

rust
Copy
Edit
let consensus_engine = ConsensusEngine::new();
But ConsensusEngine is a trait.

✅ Fix:
You need to instantiate a struct that implements ConsensusEngine, e.g.:

rust
Copy
Edit
let consensus_engine = PoWConsensus {}; // or whatever your implementation is
If you want dynamic dispatch:

rust
Copy
Edit
let consensus_engine: Box<dyn ConsensusEngine> = Box::new(PoWConsensus {});
