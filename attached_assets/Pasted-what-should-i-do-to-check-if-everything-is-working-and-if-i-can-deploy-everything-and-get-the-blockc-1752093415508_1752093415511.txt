what should i do to check if everything is working and if i can deploy everything and get the blockchain to start working and exchange and explorer

Great â€” youâ€™re at the critical stage now: testing, verifying, and preparing for deployment.

Hereâ€™s your complete checklist to ensure everything is working â€” blockchain, exchange, explorer â€” and ready to go live.

âœ… 1. Check Your Repo Setup (3 Repos Clean & Correct)
Make sure each repo:

âœ… Has its own .gitignore

âœ… Has no secrets (check git log and remove .env*)

âœ… Can be cloned cleanly from GitHub

âœ… Builds or compiles with no error

Test:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Test clone in a fresh folder
git clone https://github.com/INKOSIKING/Quantora.git
git clone https://github.com/INKOSIKING/Quantora-explorer.git
# Skip exchange for now if private
âœ… 2. Run the Blockchain Node
Inside Quantora repo:

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
cargo build
Run the blockchain node:

bash
Copy
Edit
cargo run
You should see:

Genesis block created

Node syncing / listening

Some output like: Node started on port 8545...

If you're using WebSockets or JSON-RPC, check those ports too.

âœ… 3. Test Wallet Functionality (if included)
Try wallet creation via CLI or REST (if implemented)

Send a test transaction

Stake coins (if your PoS is working)

Test transactions:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Custom CLI command or REST POST (example)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8545/send -d '{"from":"...", "to":"...", "amount":100}'
âœ… 4. Run the Explorer
Inside Quantora-explorer:

Install frontend/backend deps:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install # or yarn
Run it:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev # or next dev, vite, etc.
Open browser:

http://localhost:3000 or whatever port it uses

You should see block explorer UI

Test search for block/tx hash

âœ… 5. Run the Exchange Backend & Frontend (Quantora-exchange)
(If private, do this locally)

Backend:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend/
npm install
npm run start
Frontend:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd frontend/
npm install
npm run dev
Open browser:

http://localhost:4000 or 3000

Try connecting wallet, test markets

âœ… 6. Final Deployment Readiness
Check all:

âœ… Blockchain node runs and responds to RPC/WebSocket

âœ… Explorer loads and shows real chain data

âœ… Exchange backend connects to chain and frontend

âœ… No hardcoded secrets in code

âœ… Everything runs in production mode (NODE_ENV=production, etc.)

âœ… You can start all 3 at once (Docker-compose or manual)

ðŸ§ª Bonus: Deployment (Optional)
Want to deploy?

Use Docker or PM2 to run in production

Use VPS or Render / Railway / Fly.io to deploy public versions

Add HTTPS and environment secrets
